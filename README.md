# CARTO-SDSC2022

## Retail and Geodemographics: A Spatial Data Science Approach.

Patrick Ballantyne, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University of Liverpool 

## Workshop Overview

This workshop will introduce users to 'geodemographics' as a tool for better understanding the characteristics of people living within the catchments of stores. Using the excellent SafeGraph places database, users will be introduced to a geodemographic classification built by GDSL researchers, and shown various techniques in the open-source programming language R, for profiling the catchments of stores. 


## Materials

The workbook for 'Retail and Geodemographics: A Spatial Data Science Approach' can be found [HERE](https://github.com/patrickballantyne/CARTO-SDSC2022/blob/main/Workbook.Rmd). 

The data for this workshop includes the following:

- SafeGraph places for Atlanta Metro Area, available to download [HERE](https://github.com/patrickballantyne/CARTO-SDSC2022/tree/main/Data).
- US Geodemographic classification, based on [Spielman and Singleton (2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335), available to download [HERE](https://github.com/patrickballantyne/CARTO-SDSC2022/tree/main/Data).
- Population data from the US Census Bureau, using the [tidycensus R package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/). 

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to SafeGraph for providing workshop participants with the subset of their places database.

Thanks to Prof. Alex Singleton for granting access to the use of their US Geodemographic classification for this workshop.

Thanks to all the excellent R package developers such as Kyle Walker (for tidyverse), who make open, reproducible analysis such as the one presented in this workshop accessible for all. 

Thanks to the CDRC and University of Liverpool for supporting this workshop.
