## Retail and Geodemographics: A Spatial Data Science Approach.

Patrick Ballantyne, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University of Liverpool 

This workshop will introduce users to 'geodemographics' as a tool for better understanding the characteristics of people living within the catchments of stores. Using the excellent SafeGraph places database, users will be introduced to a geodemographic classification built by GDSL researchers, and shown various techniques in the open-source programming language R, for profiling the catchments of stores.
